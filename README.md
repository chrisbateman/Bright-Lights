=============

This was an app I made for the iOS App Store. It was there for a year, where it made a small profit - but it's really too simplistic to be worth keeping there, so I let my developer license expire.

I wrote this code in 2012. I'd probably do a number of things differently now, but oh well. It worked.

Some native iOS code initialized the menu (for i18n), so that currently isn't working. No mouse support either. I'm planning to make some updates so fix those issues.
