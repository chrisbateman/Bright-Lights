Bright Lights
=============

This was an app I made a couple years ago for the iOS App Store (it's no longer available there). It was limited to iPhone 4+ on the App Store. It attempts to compensate for slower devices, but YMMV. Androids were particurly slow when I first tested them, but maybe they've improved since then.

I wrote this code in 2012. I'd probably do a number of things differently now, but oh well. It worked.

I'm in the process of making some updates to make the app suitable for the open web:

**Completed Updates:**
 - Switched from touch events to pointer events (hand.js as polyfill) 
 - Ported menu initialization from Objective-C

**Needed Updates:**
 - Adjust menu animations to adapt to screens larger than 1024px
 - Menu i18n
